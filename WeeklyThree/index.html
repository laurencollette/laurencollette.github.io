      <p> I honestly felt like I was missing a bigger joke or something in this
         article… Towards the beginning of the piece, I could wrap my head
         around some of what the author was arguing. Comments like “a high-
         resolution image looks more brilliant and impressive, more mimetic and
         magic, more scary and seductive than a poor one” made total sense to me
         and I agreed with it. But slowly, the author started to lose me. When I
         read things like “Resolution was fetishized as if its lack amounted to
         castration of the author” I couldn’t help but think:

      <p> And I do understand the meta-ness and irony of that image given how
        low quality it is! But that truly has never (and still doesn’t) really
        strike me as a social valuation or a technological castration of the
        person who took and shared this image. To me, it’s just… a meme. The
        photo was probably taken in 2007 and put on Facebook by someone sharing
        pictures from their family vacation. From there, someone zoomed into
        the guy in the background and shared it on their Facebook page or with
        their friends. Because it was taken on a point and shoot and added on
        Facebook in a low resolution so that it could be easily downloaded and
        shared, it’s not very good quality. But that’s kinda where the story
        ends for me. True, I guess the lack of resolution in this image attests
        to its appropriation and displacement, but jumping from that to “the
        dematerialized art object turns out to be perfectly adapted to the
        semioticization of capital, and thus to the conceptual turn of
        capitalism.” I don’t know if that’s me not being bright enough to
        understand that claim or if it is, what I like to call, reading into it.

        But then, where would all these deep-fried political memes come from?
        Maybe she knows something I don’t.
