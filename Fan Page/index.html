      <h3>In Addition to Having a Good Dog...</h3>

      <p>-Eric Fanghanel is an LA based Mexican born artist creating contingent
        identities through assemblages - both as collage and networks - using
        science fiction, virtual reality, artificial intelligences and living
        systems. Through moments of joy and alienation, the work presents
        viewers with a radical otherness, inviting them to become alien. Eric is
        a media artist researching post-human and non-human subjectivities arising
        from complex decentralized networks. He is also a developer involved in
        JOLOCOM a Berlin based project working to develop an app aimed at the
        decentralization of the internet, where users own their digital identities
        through linked data and blockchain technology</p>
