      <h3>High Thoughts (Sorry If That's Inappropriate)</h3>

      <p> I watched Love and Power in two parts. The first half I watched at
        night, high and curled up in my bed, deep in my own thought. I was truly
        affected by what Ayn Rand was saying. It made sense to me. I have been
        trying for so long to teach myself that it’s not selfish to seek
        self-fulfillment and prioritize your own happiness. I’ve spent so much
        time trying to please others and desperately seek everyone’s validation
        and it’s gotten me nowhere. So I really did like her rhetoric about not
        sacrificing your own goals and pleasures to fulfill societal expectations
        or norms. </p>

        <p>  So I went to therapy the next day and told my therapist about these
          ideas. I was excited about them! I honestly thought it was a
          breakthrough. I said to her, “Wow, I waste so much time trying to
          please other people and do what I think people expect me to do. I
          think I could implement a little Ayn Rand into my life.” She laughed
          and said she saw where I was coming from. </p2>

        <p>  However, when I went home and finished the documentary, I realized
          that Rand’s philosophy is not without flaw. To me, I understood it
          most clearly in the human and romantic stories. To be quite honest,
          the political and financial parts were confusing to me. But, the
          sections about Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton and Ayn and Nathanial
          shed light on the flawed parts of Rand’s idealogy. Ayn was basically
          every modern woman when she says “well I want you to have an affair
          with ME but if you have an affair with someone ELSE you’re a disloyal
          pig.” She didn’t practice what she preached. She wanted full freedom
          to do what makes her happy, but denied someone else’s right to do so.
          Similar with the case of Bill Clinton. He wanted the freedom to hook
          up with a beautiful, young woman who wasn’t Hillary but this
          dishonesty and secrecy makes us question him as a leader.
        </div>
      <div id="text">
        <p>  We do want freedom and the ability to follow our instincts and do
          what makes us happy. But total happiness with disregard to everyone
          else that exists in our world? That’s just apathetic and destined for
          anarchy.
